# 🛰️ Source of Flavor
## Project Description
Source of Flavor is an open-source initiative that uses remote sensing and geospatial science to illuminate the story behind the foods we eat. From satellite imagery to climate indicators, we trace the journey of agricultural products from where they are grown to where they are sold.

By connecting geography, environmental data, and food systems, we aim to foster transparency, support climate-resilient agriculture, and advocate for a more sustainable and equitable future. Our tools and visualizations help users (whether farmers, researchers, or eaters) understand how climate, land use, and local expertise shape the flavor and future of our food.

## 🌍 Mission
* Map the movement of food from farm to market

* Understand how geography and climate affect flavor and farming conditions

* Cultivate relationships between consumers and producers

* Empower local growers with global context for more sustainable practices

## 🧰 Usage Examples
Most of the code in this repository is written for Google Earth Engine (GEE). We are also working on translating these scripts into Python using geemap and hosting them via Google Colab for broader accessibility.

### Vegetation Health: NDVI Animation

This animation shows NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) over time, providing a view into vegetation health in a key agricultural region. Higher NDVI values indicate more vigorous plant growth.

### Heat Stress Monitoring: Land Surface Temperature (LST)

This animation captures predicted land surface temperatures (LST), a key factor in assessing crop viability and risk of heat stress in sensitive stages of growth.

### False Color

False color composites use near-infrared and shortwave infrared bands to highlight vegetation health, burn scars, and water content—revealing changes invisible to the naked eye.

### Soil Moisture

This visualization uses satellite-derived soil moisture data to show how water availability in the root zone changes over time. Soil moisture is a critical factor for crop health, especially during germination and early growth phases.

## 🔓 Open Data for the Geospatial Community
We believe that sharing our methods and visuals supports a more collaborative and resilient geospatial community. That’s why all our code is open-source—available for adaptation, expansion, or use in local contexts.

If you're building for farmers, researchers, or the public good—please take what you need and share what you learn.

## 🛠️ Coming Soon
* 🌐 Python versions of our GEE scripts using geemap
* 📊 Jupyter/Colab notebooks for reproducible analysis
* 🧪 Tutorials on satellite data for flavor, resilience, and sustainability

## 🤝 Contributing
We're actively building this project and welcome contributions from developers, scientists, farmers, and storytellers. If you have an idea for a new use case or want to collaborate on visual storytelling, open an issue or pull request!
